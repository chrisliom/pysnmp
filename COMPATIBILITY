Backward compatibility of PySNMP 3.x
------------------------------------

In its 3.x reincarnation, the PySNMP codebase went through a major re-write of
it internals for a more accurate, standards compliant and extensible
implementation. Complete compatibility with all previous PySNMP revisions,
at documented API level, is preserved by means of compatibility package
(pysnmp_compat).

That is, an application relying on a PySNMP 2.x API, to make use of PySNMP 3.x
code, should either:

* Modify Python modules search path ($PYTHONPATH) to refer to compatibility
  modules (.../pysnmp_compat/pysnmp2x/) instead of their native 2.x 
  counterparts.

* Modify application `import' operator to make it importing compatibility
  modules.

  For example:

>>>from pysnmp import asn1, v1, v2c
>>>from pysnmp import role

import their compatibility comterparts of PySNMP 3.x in the following way:

>>>from pysnmp_compat.pysnmp2x import asn1, v1, v2c
>>>from pysnmp_compat.pysnmp2x import role

If anything in 3.x release still appears to be incompatible with either 1.x
or 2.x PySNMP revisions, please, let me know so I will do my best to fix it.
