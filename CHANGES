Revision 4.1.1a
---------------

- UNSTABLE ALPHA RELEASE.
- SNMPv3 code first published
- SNMP engine and applications implemented on library level
- Major re-design towards SNMPv3-style API.

Release 4.0.2a
--------------

- Adopted to slightly changed asyncore API (as shipped with python 2,4)

Release 4.0.1a
--------------

- Minor bug/typo fixes, mostly in example/ scripts.

Release 4.0.0a
--------------

- UNSTABLE EARLY ALPHA RELEASE.
- Major re-design and re-implementation.
- Rudimental API versioning implemented to let incompatible package
  branches to co-exist within the same Python installation.
- SMI framework designed and implemented. This framework provides 
  1) various access to MIB data 2) a way to implement custom MIB
  instrumentation objects. There's also a tool for building SMI classes
  from libsmi(3) output (smidump -f python).
- ASN.1 subtyping machinery implemented. Now dynamic ASN.1 instances
  subtyping and quering becomes available. Previously, this has been done
  through Python classes inheritance what proved to be a wrong concept.
- ASN.1 codecs framework re-designed and re-implemented aimed at a more
  consistent design and better performance. Highlights include abstract
  codec interface and serialized data caching (at encoder).
- Asn1Item constraints machinery re-implemented based on Mike C. Fletcher's
  design and code. Now various constrains are implemented as stand-alone
  objects serving interested Asn1Object derivatives through some abstract
  protocol (that's probably the Decorator design pattern).
- ASN.1 tagging facility re-implemented along the client-server design
  pattern. Besides this seems to be a more appropriate design, it allows
  an easier way for dynamic subtyping.
